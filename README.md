# FCC Directory

Scrapes and parses the publicly-available [FCC staff directory](https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/findpeople.pl?person=202). Currently only scrapes info about staff members who have phone numbers in the 202 area code.

## Help wanted

Turn this into a servo (like [SCOTUS Servo](https://github.com/vzvenyach/scotus-servo)):

- Run the script daily
- Detect staff changes
- Tweet/email the changes
